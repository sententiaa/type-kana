A quiz app to help you learn
<ruby>
ひらがな<rp>(</rp><rt>hiragana</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>
and
<ruby>
カタカナ<rp>(</rp><rt>katakana</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>, the Japanese syllabaries.

If you are just looking to play, a hosted version of whatever is currently on the `main` branch should be available [here](https://type-kana.furudean.com/). No promises of uptime though!

## Thanks to
